# Notes on [set of courses](https://www.coursera.org/professional-certificates/ai-engineer#courses) by IBM

### Repo structure:
- Each course placed in separate folder
- Each course consists of several sub-parts, "weeks"
- Inside each week, notes on topics are placed in jupyter .ipynb files, with attachments in corresponding directories

### Notice
- During this set of courses I was aiming for effeciency, rather than completionsm, so some parts were skipped
- Some topics, I wanted to dive deeper into were extended though
